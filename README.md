# Our Sports Club
 Like Wii Sports Resort

 You may be wondering why there is only a text file here, well rest assured I'm actually working on this project.
 Ultimately, the project is just too large to be stored here. It's a mixture of being a complex project that I am invested in, but also not that invested to need to pay for storage. Of course I'll always accept donations to allow this to happen. Which in any case if you would like to help me with this project, reach out to me and we can work out how you can access the files.

 So what is Our Sports Club? Well like I said earlier, it's just like Wii Sports Resort, but for the modern PC and console. The dream is to implement it into a VR system to emulate the original Wii MotionPlus systems. The magic just isn't the same on the PC, but it's easier to start there. The goal is for the game to have all the same sports and events as the original game, but instead it'll be an open world environment.
 Currently I'm using Unity to develop the game, Dolphin for comparison of the actual game, and BrawlCrate for most of the asset "borrowing" and porting over.
